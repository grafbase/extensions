"""
The @requiresScopes directive restricts access to GraphQL fields or
types based on the scopes provided.

Fields or types marked with this directive will only be accessible
if the requesting user has at least one of the scopes from each
array in the provided nested array of scopes.

For example, `@requiresScopes(scopes: [["read:posts"], ["admin", "editor"]])`
requires that the user has both "read:posts" AND either "admin" OR "editor"
scope to access the field or type.
